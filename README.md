# PYNP - Python Nodeping API Module

A Python module for interacting with your NodePing configuration.

# Changelog

* **Version 0.1:** Basic 'get' functionality in place. Can build a local representation of the main account, all SubAccounts, and checks for each. Includes a feature to create a new SubAccount as a promise of things to come. Can also operate without a local copy, in which 'get' methods can be called directly without the overhead of building a full local representation.
